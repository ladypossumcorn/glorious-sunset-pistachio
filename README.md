# Glorious Sunset
Gruvbox-based theme for [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle) with edited accents. This is my first attempt at theming.

If you like the theme, feel free giving this fork or the original repository a **★ star**, or by [buying eeriemyxi a coffee, as they did most of the work for this theme](https://github.com/sponsors/eeriemyxi).

# Installation
